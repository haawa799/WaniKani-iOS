##This app

I build few related Pods specifically for this app:

* [StrokeDrawingView](https://github.com/haawa799/StrokeDrawingView) - view that displays stroke based drawing, such as kanji.
- [WaniKit](https://github.com/haawa799/WaniKit) - API client for iOS
+ [KanjiBezierPaths](https://github.com/haawa799/KanjiBezierPaths) - pod which contains 6,5k kanji database with stroke order info


####❗️I build this app for myself, I'm not paid to do this. I consider this app as a good CV for my next job interview, so if you are an employer leave me a note ^ __ ^. For the rest of you folks, enjoy the app!
